## Type-Driven Development

You are to practice Type-Driven Development as much as possible. 

- Model the domain with the type-system
- Make use of abstractions found in category theory
- Derive implementation as much as possible from the type-system
- Encode invariants in the type-system

## Test-Driven Development

Once we are happy with our type-based abstractions, we can then write tests for our implementation.

- Practice a red-green refactor loop
